Data README

In order for the dataset processing code to work, you need to download the full Hand image set from here "https://sites.google.com/view/11khands".
Then, unzip it. The dataset processing code will extract all the palm images from the full image set and create a new folder named PalmImages.
Using the labels HandInfo.csv, it also creates a new file for the palm labels called PalmInfo.csv in the data file.

Download the file correct_images from "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1caQJ-vNuQe7uuU6ZWNCwcWucrBbvT_3p/view?usp=sharing". This is a set of image that I processed by hand to make sure that wrists and palm were completely visible. There may be some images that were tagged by accident.
