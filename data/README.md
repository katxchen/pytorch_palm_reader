Data README

In order for the dataset processing code to work, you need to download the full Hand image set from here "https://sites.google.com/view/11khands".
Then, unzip it. The dataset processing code will extract all the palm images from the full image set and create a new folder named PalmImages.
Using the labels HandInfo.csv, it also creates a new file for the palm labels called PalmInfo.csv in the data file.
